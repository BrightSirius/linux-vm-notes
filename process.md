# Process Address Space

## 64-bit Address Space

* In [current x86-64 implementations][x86-64-address-space] only the lower 48
  bits of an address are used - the remaining higher order bits must all be
  equal to the 48th bit, i.e. allowable addresses are 128TiB (47 bits) in the
  `0000000000000000` - `00007fffffffffff` range, and 128TiB (47 bits) in the
  `ffff800000000000` - `ffffffffffffffff` range - the address space is divided
  into upper and lower portions.

* In fact, reading the [x86-64 memory map doc][x86-64-mm], only 46 bits (64TiB)
  of RAM is supported - this makes sense, as it allows for the entire physical
  address space to be mapped into the kernel while leaving another 64TiB free
  for other kernel data.

* In linux, like most (if not all?) other operating systems, this provides a
  nice separation between kernel and user address space for free - keep kernel
  addresses in the upper portion and user addresses in the lower portion.

* Taking another quick look at the [memory map][x86-64-mm]:

```
...
0000000000000000 - 00007fffffffffff (=47 bits) user space, different per mm
hole caused by [48:63] sign extension
ffff800000000000 - ffff87ffffffffff (=43 bits) guard hole, reserved for hypervisor
ffff880000000000 - ffffc7ffffffffff (=64 TB) direct mapping of all phys. memory
...
```

### Kernel Address Translation

* We can see there's a gap reserved for the hypervisor between ffff800000000000
  and ffff87ffffffffff, immediately after which the entire 64TiB physical
  address space is mapped.

* This allows us to have a simple means of translating from a physical address
  to a virtual one within the kernel - simply offset the physical one by
  `ffff880000000000`. This constant is defined as [PAGE_OFFSET][PAGE_OFFSET] (an
  alias for [__PAGE_OFFSET][__PAGE_OFFSET].)

* More generally to translate from virtual to physical addresses and vice-versa
  in the kernel, two functions are available - [phys_to_virt()][phys_to_virt] (a
  wrapper around [__va()][__va]) and [virt_to_phys()][virt_to_phys] (a wrapper
  around [__pa()][__pa].)

* Give that we have `PAGE_OFFSET` [__va()][__va] is simple:

```c
#define __va(x) ((void *)((unsigned long)(x)+PAGE_OFFSET))
```

* [__pa()][__pa] is a little more complicated - It invokes
  [__phys_addr()][__phys_addr], which (assuming we haven't set
  `CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL`) subsequently invokes
  [__phys_addr_nodebug()][__phys_addr_nodebug]:

```c
#define __pa(x) __phys_addr((unsigned long)(x))

...

#define __phys_addr(x) __phys_addr_nodebug(x)

...

static inline unsigned long __phys_addr_nodebug(unsigned long x)
{
        unsigned long y = x - __START_KERNEL_map;

        /* use the carry flag to determine if x was < __START_KERNEL_map */
        x = y + ((x > y) ? phys_base : (__START_KERNEL_map - PAGE_OFFSET));

        return x;
}
```

* What is [__START_KERNEL_map][__START_KERNEL_map] (which is defined as
  `ffffffff80000000`)? We can see from the [memory map][x86-64-mm] that this is
  the virtual address above which the kernel is loaded:

```
...
ffffffff80000000 - ffffffffa0000000 (=512 MB)  kernel text mapping, from phys 0
ffffffffa0000000 - ffffffffff5fffff (=1526 MB) module mapping space
ffffffffff600000 - ffffffffffdfffff (=8 MB) vsyscalls
ffffffffffe00000 - ffffffffffffffff (=2 MB) unused hole
```

* [__phys_addr_nodebug()][__phys_addr_nodebug] therefore differentiates between
  virtual addresses that have been mapped from the direct physical mapping at
  [__PAGE_OFFSET][__PAGE_OFFSET] and those that originate from the kernel itself
  from [__START_KERNEL_map][__START_KERNEL_map] on.

* One important thing to note here is that [phys_base][phys_base] is used to
  offset the returned address if it is indeed a reference to a kernel symbol -
  this is a value that is [determined on startup][phys_base-fixup] in case the
  kernel is loaded higher than expected. This might occur if the kernel is
  loaded via [kdump][kdump] for example (more details are available in
  [Kdump: Smarter, Easier, Trustier (PDF)][kdump-paper], a paper on the
  subject.)
